# Financial Complaint NLP Assistant

This project uses consumer financial complaint narratives to build toward an NLP system that can classify complaints by product category and support complaint triage.

The current work focuses on exploratory data analysis of the processed complaint dataset. The EDA checks data quality, class balance, narrative length, important terms, and category overlap before moving into modeling.

## How to Read This Project

Start with the notebooks in this order:

1. [EDA notebook](notebooks/EDA.ipynb)
   - Understand the dataset, class imbalance, duplicate records, text length, and important terms.
2. [Modeling notebook](notebooks/Modeling.ipynb)
   - Train a baseline classifier using the choices motivated by the EDA.

The project flow is:

```text
raw complaint narratives
-> EDA and data quality checks
-> remove missing and duplicate text
-> compare Bag of Words and TF-IDF baselines
-> tune the top 3 validation models
-> evaluate the selected model
-> save the classifier locally
-> run prediction examples
-> confusion matrix and error review
```

## Project Status

Completed:

- Data setup instructions
- Exploratory data analysis notebook
- Class distribution review
- Text length analysis
- TF-IDF term analysis
- Word clouds by product category
- Modeling recommendations
- Baseline complaint classification model

Next planned step:

- Add deeper error analysis for the most confused product categories.

## Data Setup

This project uses a Kaggle dataset. Data files are not included in the repository.

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place the file in the project root:

- Dataset: [Consumer Complaints Dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/consume-complaints-dataset-fo-nlp)
- File used: `complaints_processed.csv`

Expected local layout:

```text
financial-complaint-nlp-genai-assistant/
+-- complaints_processed.csv
+-- notebooks/
    +-- EDA.ipynb
```

The EDA notebook reads the data with:

```python
data_path = '../complaints_processed.csv'
```

So run `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` from inside the `notebooks/` folder or open it normally in Jupyter from the project directory.

Data files are listed in `.gitignore` and should not be committed.

## Notebook

- [EDA notebook](notebooks/EDA.ipynb)
- [Modeling notebook](notebooks/Modeling.ipynb)

The EDA notebook includes:

- Dataset shape and missing value checks
- Duplicate and short-text checks
- Product category distribution
- Class imbalance calculation
- Complaint length analysis
- High-signal TF-IDF terms and bigrams
- Category overlap review
- Word clouds for each product category
- Modeling recommendations

## EDA Highlights

- The full dataset contains 162,421 complaints across 5 product categories.
- `credit_reporting` is the largest class, creating a clear class imbalance.
- Missing complaint narratives are minimal.
- Bigrams are more useful than single words for separating product categories.
- Banking-related categories share vocabulary and may need closer error analysis during modeling.

## Modeling Plan

The baseline modeling notebook includes:

- Cleaning missing or empty complaint narratives
- Removing exact duplicate narratives before splitting
- Stratified train/test split
- Bag of Words and TF-IDF text features
- Comparison of Dummy, Naive Bayes, SGD, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM models
- Top 3 model selection before tuning
- Model selection using validation macro F1
- Macro F1, weighted F1, and per-class recall
- Saved model generation with `joblib`
- Example predictions on new complaint text
- Confusion matrix and error analysis

Selected model:

- Model: `TFIDF_LinearSVC_ngram(1, 3)_min3_C0.5`
- Macro F1: 0.85
- Weighted F1: 0.86
- Error rate: 13.66%

How to interpret this:

- Macro F1 gives each class equal weight, so it is important for this imbalanced dataset.
- Weighted F1 accounts for class size and is useful for overall model performance.
- The gap between macro F1 and weighted F1 shows that minority classes still need attention.
- The confusion matrix should be used to find which product categories overlap the most.

After removing exact duplicate narratives, the baseline is a more honest estimate of model performance because the same complaint text is less likely to appear in both training and test data.

## Model Artifact

The modeling notebook saves the selected classifier locally:

```text
models/complaint_classifier.joblib
```

The artifact is ignored by Git because it can be regenerated from the notebook and may become large.

## Requirements

Main Python packages used:

```text
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
wordcloud
jupyter
joblib
```

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
